This example uses an fbx file format with a 3d graphic character that also moves. 
It uses a js script to "translate" the fbx file and I changed the original character with a dancing stormtrooper. 
I couldn't find where the mesh is added and used in the code, although when I downloaded the fbx file of the stormtrooper has a .png and .jpg file. 
However, the original code of the samba-dancing character didn't have the png, so maybe some fbx files have them integrated. 

Because the mesh is not connected to the actual character, I couldn't scale it and make it larger. So now it's a tiny dancing stormtrooper and I've moved the camera closer to it.
