In this example, I followed a guided tutorial from: 
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABV1mK1CGOY&list=PL08jItIqOb2qyMOhtEUoLh100KpccQiRf"
that creates a rotating cube in WebGl using the Three js library. 

The extension of this example was the sphere, the mesh texture and the background. 
In the original code there was a rotating cube that I changed to a sphere using resources from the threejs site. 
The mesh texture e.i the moon picture was also added on the sphere. This was found through googling as well as the background, there was a green default scene screen that was changed to the star filled background.
